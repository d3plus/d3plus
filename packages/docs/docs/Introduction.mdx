D3plus is an open-source visualization library that attempts to streamline the creation of beautiful data visualizations with only a few lines of code. D3plus acts as an abstraction on top of the popular D3 library. Think of D3plus as a shortcut to great visualizations. After only setting a few parameters specific to your data, D3plus will handle all the generic things that are normally taken for granted, such as setting up mouse events, color assignment, and label placement.
